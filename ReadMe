TS Flights back-end will have these main responsibilities:
• Handle requests from the front-end for information
• Create, Read, Update and Delete plane flights in the system
• Send info back to the front-end in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation)

The back-end’s primary responsibility is the processing of data, where the front-end’s main responsibility is the displaying of data and handling user interaction. Front-ends process data as well, but heavy data manipulation is generally within the domain of the back-end.

On the front-end we will be using Angular. On the back-end we will be using NestJS.
